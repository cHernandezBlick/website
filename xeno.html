<p>Xeno Vehicles: <br>Nature, Technology & Matter in the Post-Anthropocene</p>
</div>
<div class="text">    
Of all the destabilizing vectors proliferating through the turbulent field of entangled contemporary crises, few rival the Anthropocene in their magnitude and consequence. For those who have yet to encounter the term, the Anthropocene is a title popularized by atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen as a means of characterizing novel features of planetary life that distinguish the earth system from its previous paradigm, the Holocene. It seeks to describe a geological epoch wherein the collective activity of the human species constitutes an amplified telluric influence. Moreover, it is suspected that if the modern economic matrices of work, energy, material flows, and environmental production associated with the Anthropocene continue to proliferate at their current rate, Homo Sapiens will effectively endanger the sustainability of our shared and finite ecological operating space. 
<p>
Our mutual condition is that of irreversible and abrupt changes to the fundamental parameters of life on this planet. 
<p>
Far from denoting our intellectual, cultural, and/or ecological mastery over nature, the causes and effects of the Anthropocene are instead strongly correlated with some of the most epistemologically impoverished superstitions of modernity, ultimately subtended by the arc of what media theorist Benjamin Bratton has called “anthropolysis”. As paradoxical result of such delusions, the vertices of the modern project (with particular emphasis reserved for the “constitutional purification” of humanity and nature) have invoked both their own realization, while arguably undoing the viability of their purportedly eternal supremacy. 
<p>
That is, respectively:<br>
1) Modernity naturalized an objectified and mechanistically-determined world, modelled in the image of a kind of industrial-humanist diagram where reality is atomic and predictable. 
<p>
2) All the while instigating a catastrophic binding of social and global geologic ecologies whose final consequence may be the biospheric compromise of a once remarkably accommodating support system for complex forms of habitability.
<p>
In other words, the Anthropocene is an eco-historical procedure by which our geo-metaphysical myths about planetary reality actually produced a planetary-scale process that is at odds with our initial intuitions of such. Perhaps, we might speculate, in such strange and  inverted temporal act, the Anthropocene uses the human species as a medium for undoing that very progenitor that brought it into existence.    
<p>       
But this undoing, what does it mean? Extinction? Post-human? Inhuman? Speciation? Cultural or biological evolution–or both? What does this demystification afford? What perspectives might it uncover?  
<p>
Despite the relative novelty of human-influenced ecosystemic eradication (notwithstanding the “Megafauna Extinction”), massive planetary-scale extinguishment, and subsequent phylogenetic re-blooming, are not unprecedented events in the earth’s cosmological timeline. That is, while many extant terrestrial species may have good reason to fear the projected outcomes of this Anthropocene, the perspectives of deep geologic and evolutionary time have no comparable concern. So then, while the Anthropocene indexes the perilous contingency of Holocene human stability, so too does it portend phase-spaces of a range of post-anthropic adaptations, variation, and novelty. 
<p>
The mere consideration of such nascent avenues for anthropolytic reconfiguration is likely to instigate pronounced anxieties, not least of all a series of once unthinkable ruptures in the fabric of stubborn modern hubris and its closely guarded human exceptionalism. One disenchantment of principle concern, then, is that at an elemental level the human is only ever a porous and ecologically interdependent organism maintaining a metaphysically unexceptional position within, and relational inseparability from, the perpetual and mutable totality of terrestrial transformations. To imagine the mundanity of extinction within the purview of planetary processes is to embrace not merely a post-human-centric humility, but the fact that all actions are embedded in the cosmic circuits whose consequences exceed our most parochial motivations. 
<p>
Thus, while traumas of epistemological privilege multiply, we might take this opportunity to consider that–while intelligence (sensing & abstraction) has always been immanent in the material continuum of (inter)planetary matter, and the elaborate trajectories of its biochemical intensities–the cognitive capacity of matter needn’t find its apex, nor singularity, in the symbolic reticulation and metabolic evolution of the anthropic actor alone. 
<p>
The fact that our present identity is commensurate with a linguistic planetary consciousness–a culmination of bio-geochemical currents of matter and energy, and the evolutionary patterns of their organizational development, genetic expression, and environmental adaptation–does not mean that intelligence cannot, has not, and will not, emerge once more via wholly inhuman aggregates of (in)-organic terrestrial architecture. Or that it is not already present in systems unrecognizable from our own cultural and cognitive perspectives. Intelligence is not ours. It is an intricately nested undertaking, mediated by many endo-symbiotic collaborations within the earth’s web of living and non-living processes. Moreover, its functional actualization is spread across a qualitatively differentiated matrix comprising highly variegated agents. Intelligence is something like biology abstracting itself, constructing niches that facilitate its development, indifferent to any one specific substrate or instrument. The Anthropocene threatens to sabotage our conception of intelligence, its distribution, actualization, intentions. It reconfigures our relationship to it via scales largely unbeknownst to us before.    
<p>
All of this is not to carelessly proclaim that the human is not itself unique. After all, the species happens to be one of the most technologically robust ecosystem-engineers that the planet has thus far produced. Indeed, this observation is not limited to our contemporary global and networked Promethean manifestations alone, despite being historically accentuated as the technological accomplishment largely responsible for the Anthropocene itself. Encompassing an idiosyncratic spectrum of developmental, socio-cultural, and epochal dispositions, hominid evolution has always purposefully engaged in advanced technical activity, such as landscape management and alteration, environmental manipulation, and the co-production of techno-biophysical automation, inextricably connected to contextually relevant conditions of sociality, reproduction, and power. 
<p>
In extension to this insight, the labor of any post-anthropic or anthropolytic organism (that is, progeny of an Anthropos, yet inverted and modulated to meet novel, albeit temporary, and unstable parameters of a hitherto unknown bio-geochemical paradigm) must contend with both the deeply technologized modalities of its own nature, and the double-movement of socially inscriptive overdetermination, that informs its technical artifacts, collective apparatuses, and constituent effects. In other words, it would be premature and fundamentally naive to rebuke technological complexity itself for the undesired or cataclysmic ramifications that we foresee in this Anthropocene. Indeed, one of the most salient and pressing insights gleaned from this planetary state-shift is that nature, culture, and technology are not discrete objects. Instead, it may be in our best interests to thoroughly contemplate the unified, multidirectional complementarity of techno-bio-social relations, acknowledging, in the words of media researcher Bogna M. Konior, that “nature grasped properly is technology and technology grasped properly is nature.”
<p>
Thus, a re-naturalization of the nominally “artificial” processes that characterize environment/human co-relations, and a revaluation of the biocidal tendencies embedded in both industrial and trans-classical machines, are both equally necessary should the Anthropocene be apprehended as an opportunity for radically alternative forms of planetary permaculture.
<p>
In summary, a disenchanted dissensus from the theology of the human, and the re-naturalized technical dynamics of a generalized socio-biological labor-experience, in and against nature, may be promising departure points for renegotiating our loci within the determinations of a post-Anthropocene. Yet, ultimately, if we are to survive as one (or many) post-anthropic species, it may only be due to the production, and cultivation, of a plethora of still unnamed knowledge and practices which are truly alien to any of the social, cultural, political, and/or economic pathologies with which we have become so familiarized, comfortable, and even desirous of.  
<p>
And so, within this forthcoming ecology, this unfamiliar manifold of iteratively refashioned natures–informatic, energetic, social, organic, technical, cultural, geologic, economic, machinic, biochemical–what models for xeno-systemic abstraction, what geo-somatic anatomies, will we co-produce, and be co-produced by, in an effort to shuffle matter and energy through untested patterns of functionality, cognition, sensoriality, and affectation? What are these cosmological vehicles, waiting to realized through the raw prehension of earth’s interdependent and undulating (a)biotic flux?   And do we recognize, in the vein of Gilbert Simondon, the perpetual ontogenetic individuation, transductive actualization, and anthropolytic paradigms that we will inevitably encounter, in this teeming choreographic commingling?
